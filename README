Kernagic 
--------

Kernagic is libre software for automatically kerning and spacing fonts.

Figuring out and tuning inter-glyph spacing with kerning is one of the final,
and very time consuming, refinements when mastering a typeface design. This
process adjusts both the font metrics (the normal spaces to the left and
right sides of each glyph, known as side-bearings) as well adjustments for
specific pairs of glyphs (known as kerning pairs.)

Kernagic aims to automate this process. The heuristic currently implemented
generates a raster-based distance map for measuring distances between the
facing sides of every possible glyph pair. From each map it finds an optimum
graylevel for the gap between the letter forms, and outputs a comprehensive
kerning table. 

In the future the exhaustive “optimal” kerning will be used to generate
side-bearings and compact, class-based kerning. Kernagic is structured to
allow experimentation with other heuristics, too.

If the starting point is a ttf file, you must convert quadratic
curves to cubic curves “normal” beziers before using kernagic, in the future
kernagic might support working directly with quadratic outlines as well.
To do this in fontforge invoke the action at the following menu path:
   element -> font info -> layer -> all layers cubic
