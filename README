kernagic
========

Kernagic is a tool for spacing and kerning fonts. It provides a selection of
methods that can be previewed and tuned interactively. 

To fit into a diverse set of workflows; kernagic uses UFO fonts as it's input
- UFO can act as a superset of other formats; and tools like fontforge can be
used for converting to and from it.

Some methods relies on automatically detected stems, if the detected stems
work poorly with your font or you want to override spacing decisions, you can
insert your own stems by clicking in the preview; override stems are
persistent across saves of the UFO.

When a good setting is found it can be stored back into the UFO file being
edited; this shifts the x coordinates of glyphs, and writes a new advance
value.

For help about the commandline, kernagic --help is the entry-point for further
documentation.

The following subsections documents kernagics different spacing modes:

gap
---
left = period * (offset + 0.5) - lstem;

The gap method allows specifying the gap to use between stems in neighbouring
glyphs. (The resulting advance is snapped to a multiple of the period.)


rainnesance cadence table
-------------------------

This method uses a predefined spacing table; with encoded knowledge of
the glyphs morphologies. It works best on traditional rainessance fonts
with classic proportions.

Assumes that the glyphs have been designed with proportions similar to
rainessance fonts. And automatically prepares a fitting.

inkbounds
---------
simple fallback spacer - that has no side bearings
